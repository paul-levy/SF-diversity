This simple text document provides a few details on the fitting files which exist in SF_diversity/Analysis/Structures and the corresponding plots in ../Figures

fits_171128 - "baseline" model with no asymmetry, no fitting of orientation data (but yes to CRF); 
	running mod_resp_trackNLL.npy with ADAM with
		threshold approx. 1e-6, 
		learning rate = 0.1				
 		data subsample = 0 (i.e. using all data)
		starting from existing fit = no (0)

fits_180220 - same as fits_171128, but with likelihood determined by modulated poisson model
	running mod_resp_trackNLL.npy with ADAM with
		threshold 1e-8
		learning rate = 0.1
		data subsample = 0.1
		start from existing fit = no (0)
